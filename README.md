# ft_printf

### Compile with your files

If you want to create a quick prog with the static library created before :
Add the include in your header.h or in your file ⇣
```
#include "ft_printf.h"
```
Then compile just like that ⇣
```
gcc -I include -o prog yourfile1.c yourfile2.c -L. -lftprintf
```
And execute it easily ⇣
```
./prog
```
